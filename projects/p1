Scenario
Team communication and instant messaging solutions are an integral part of any business environment today. As of 2020, the total number of users of Slack and Microsoft Teams exceeded 20 million. 

Some organizations might have compliance policies in place which do not allow them to use services managed by third parties. They will prefer solutions that can be managed and hosted on servers controlled by them. The same will extend to communication solutions as well.
